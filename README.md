# python-Lists-dictionaries-sets-practice
This repository contains practice code for Python data structures such as hashing, sets, and dictionaries.  
Includes simple examples and exercises to reinforce concepts.
The code in this repository contains my personal practice solutions from CodeSignal.
All code is written independently as part of my ongoing learning and skill development.

## Files  
- `lists_practice.py`: Examples of Python lists operations  
- `sets_practice.py`: Examples of Python set operations  
- `dictionaries_practice.py`: Frequency counters and dictionary usage
- `items-search.py` & `optimsed-search-sets.py` : Search algos that utlise python structures.

## Usage

Run the Python scripts directly:

```bash
lists_practice.py
python sets_practice.py
python dictionaries_practice.py
